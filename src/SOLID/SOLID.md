The SOLID principles for low-level design. These principles provide a foundation for creating robust, maintainable software. Here they are:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or job. When designing low-level components, ensure that each class or module focuses on a specific task or functionality. This promotes better organization and easier maintenance.

2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. When adding new features or functionality, you should extend existing code rather than modifying it. This minimizes the risk of introducing bugs in existing behavior.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes (derived classes) must be substitutable for their base types (parent classes) without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, if a class adheres to an interface or base class, any derived class should be able to replace it without breaking the system.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients (classes or modules) should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Instead of creating large, monolithic interfaces, design smaller, focused interfaces that cater to specific client needs. This prevents unnecessary coupling and ensures cleaner code.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes). Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. By following this principle, you achieve loose coupling and flexibility in your system.
